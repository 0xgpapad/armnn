# The Arm NN Deserializer

The `armnnDeserializer` is a library for loading neural networks defined by Arm NN FlatBuffers files
into the Arm NN runtime.

For more information about the layers that are supported, and the networks that have been tested,
take a look at "Software Tools" -> "Deserializer" in our doxygen documentation which can be found in 
the [wiki section](https://github.com/ARM-software/armnn/wiki/Documentation) of our github repository.
