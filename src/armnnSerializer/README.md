# The Arm NN Serializer

The `armnnSerializer` is a library for serializing an Arm NN network to a stream.

For more information about the layers that are supported, and the networks that have been tested,
take a look at "Software Tools" -> "Serializer" in our doxygen documentation which can be found in the 
[wiki section](https://github.com/ARM-software/armnn/wiki/Documentation) of our github repository.
