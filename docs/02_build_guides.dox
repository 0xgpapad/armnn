This page links all guides to build and/or install Arm NN tools. Some of these guides are not hosted in our
repository and will lead you to guides on
https://developer.arm.com/solutions/machine-learning-on-arm/developer-material/how-to-guides

Arm NN is written using portable C++14 and the build system uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/), therefore it is possible
to build for a wide variety of target platforms, from a wide variety of host environments.

Arm NN is managed by a single CMake project. That allows you to build multiple tools at once by combining the CMake
options from different build guides.
